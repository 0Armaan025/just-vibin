# This is tried clone of Twitch, but couldn't make either the UI/UX or the backend by myself completely, so used ZegoCloud

<br>

## Hence, it's Just Vibin'

<br>

Do the folllowing:

<br>

- ``git clone https://github.com/0Armaan025/just-vibin``

<br>

- ``cd just-vibin``

<br>

- ``npm install``

<br>

- ``code .`` or just open the folder in an ide/editor.

<br>

- ``npm run dev``, and enjoy the project on http://localhost:3000 :D

<br>

## Thanks, make sure to give it a ‚≠ê ;)
